# startpage

If you are using Chrome or Opera, go to settings and click "Load unpacked Extension". Select the Folder 'homeProjectCSS/custom_new_tab/1/'.

Opening a new tab you need to enter the path to the startpages .html file on your local drive. Click "Set as startpage" and you're good to go!


Planned or in being worked on :
- Dark mde
- Toggle autocomplete (opt-out)
- custom background
- userfriendly settings with more degrees of freedom (colors, pages, background, custom links in dropdown menu, search engines maybe, ...)
- ability to view and edit autocomplete suggestions
- improvements in folder structure
- bugfixes and performance improvements

The startpage sould be working without the extension, bugfixes coming in the future bc I'm busy af at the moment

known bugs:
- portrait mode animation not adapted
- not working with safari
- time bar transition from 23:59 to 00:00 not working correctly
