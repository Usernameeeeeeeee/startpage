# startpage

If you are using Chrome or Opera, go to settings and click "Load unpacked Extension". Select the Folder 'homeProjectCSS/custom_new_tab/1/'.

Opening a new tab you need to enter the path to the startpages .html file on your local drive. Click "Set as startpage" and you're good to go!

"Dark mode" and "Toggle autocomplete" will be added with the next version;

The startpage sould be working without the extension, bugfixes coming in the future bc I'm busy af at the moment
