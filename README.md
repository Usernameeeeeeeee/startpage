**4) Known bugs**

# Installation

If you are using Chrome or Opera, go to settings and click "Load unpacked Extension". Select the Folder 'homeProjectCSS/custom_new_tab/1/'.

Opening a new tab you need to enter the path to the startpages .html file on your local drive. Click "Set as startpage" and you're good to go!

Notice: Very strict Ad-Blockers will mess things up a bit, so make sure to whitelist cosmetic filtering and Javascript. 
The startpage sould be working without the extension, bugfixes coming in the future bc I'm busy af at the moment

# (sort of) hidden features:
  - cycle through search engines by pressing [TAB]
  - cycle trough (visible) autocomplete suggestions with [SHIFT] + [TAB], selected will be highlighted. Next, press [ENTER] to search
  - pressing any key will focus the search bar
  - moving your mouse close to the right edge opens a sidebar with additional information and websites (settings coming soon!)
  - right-clicking any rectangle opens a specific context menu
  - left-clicking the date in the top right corner will open google calendar
